# Folder Size (C#)
Lists how much disk space is a folder consuming.
Written in c# using [DotNet Core](https://www.microsoft.com/net/learn/get-started/windows).


In order to compile the code you must type in the following command:
```
dotnet build .\FolderSize\
```

A folder named ".vscode" is included, so if using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), you can just build directly from there.

In order to generate a .exe file you can run, then run the following command:
```
dotnet build -r win10-x64 .\FolderSize\
```
